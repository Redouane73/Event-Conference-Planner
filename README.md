In the Conference Expense Planner app practice project, we built the front end of an application that allows the user to price out the expenses related to hosting a conference at a convention center.

The Conference Expense Planner have a landing page, a product selection page, and a pop-up summary window. The product selection page allows users to select their rooms, their add-ons, and meals. Based on those selections, it provides pricing. The pop-up window summarizes the expenses in a table based on the user's selections from the product selection page.
